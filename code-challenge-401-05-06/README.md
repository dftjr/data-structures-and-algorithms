# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This code shows a simple application of a functioning linked list. The test parameters make sure that the functions correctly work.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node.

2. Create a Linked List class.

3. Create these 3 methods in the class:

    - Insert

    - Includes

    - To String

4. Write tests to prove the following methods:

    - Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list.

    - Can properly insert into the linked list.

    - The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.

    - Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.

    - Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists.

    - Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist.

    - Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used a lot of reference from the demo code done in class. The tests took a bit, but once they were complete, the test were basically just figuring out the right way to convery that writing.

I tried to keep the code as simple as possible.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
